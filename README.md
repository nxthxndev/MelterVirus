# MelterVirus

Melter Virus is a harmless fake virus that melts the screen, makes flashes and simply makes the screen move, usable for pranks or things like that, but this melter does not create a page, it does it directly on the desktop which makes things more stressful
an assets folder with sound and images to make it a little scarier lol, if you want them you can leave the exe in its folder, if you remove it you will have neither sound nor image, it also writes texts, It seems to me that sometimes the sounds are buggy.

everything is false and nothing endangers your pc
the code was done entirely by me. Can you leave a star to support me ?
