# MelterVirus

Melter Virus is a harmless fake virus that melts the screen, makes flashes and simply makes the screen move, usable for pranks or things like that, but this melter does not create a page, it does it directly on the desktop which makes things more stressful
an assets folder with sound and images to make it a little scarier lol, if you want them you can leave the exe in its folder, if you remove it you will have neither sound nor image, it also writes texts, the release has already been created with mkdir and cmake
# Info

everything is false and nothing endangers your pc
the code was done entirely by me, you can find the vsproj with the .cs program and the configs just above
